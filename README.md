# ScaleStateApp

A SwiftUI application demonstrating a scalable state management architecture using composition root pattern and unidirectional data flow.

## Key Highlights

- **Pure Swift Implementation**: No third-party dependencies - built entirely with native Swift and SwiftUI
- **Modern Swift Features**: Leverages latest Swift 6 features including:
  - Strict concurrency checking
  - Actor isolation
  - @Observable macro
  - Type inference improvements
- **Thread Safety**: Implements strict concurrency checks to prevent data races
- **Zero Dependencies**: Complete control over the codebase with no external dependencies

## Architecture: Redux + Clean Architecture

The application combines principles from Redux and Clean Architecture, creating a hybrid approach that leverages the benefits of both patterns:

### Redux Pattern
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State → View → Action → Reducer → New State
- **Single Source of Truth**: State is managed in a centralized store
- **Immutable State**: All state changes are made through pure reducer functions
- **Predictable State Updates**: Actions are the only way to trigger state changes

### Clean Architecture Elements
- **Composition Root**: For dependency injection and object graph construction
- **Feature-based Structure**: Each feature is self-contained with its own views and state management
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data layers

This hybrid approach provides a scalable foundation while maintaining the simplicity needed for smaller applications.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a clean, modular architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Composition Root Pattern
The app uses a composition root pattern for dependency injection and view construction. This is implemented in `CompositionRoot.swift`.

**Benefits:**
- Centralized dependency management
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing through dependency injection
- Single source of truth for object creation
- Better control over object lifecycle

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional boilerplate code
- Potential complexity in larger applications
- Need to carefully manage shared state

### 2. Store Pattern
The app implements a custom store pattern for state management.

**Benefits:**
- Predictable state updates
- Unidirectional data flow
- Clear separation between state, actions, and side effects
- Easy to debug and test
- Thread-safe state updates

**Trade-offs:**
- More verbose compared to simple @State/@Observable
- Learning curve for developers new to Redux-like patterns
- Overhead for simple state management cases

### 3. Navigation/Routing
Uses a dedicated Router class with NavigationPath for handling navigation state.

**Benefits:**
- Centralized navigation logic
- Type-safe routing
- Easier to maintain and modify navigation flow
- Better separation of navigation concerns from view logic

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional complexity compared to direct navigation
- Need to maintain route enum
- Potential memory management considerations

## Key Features

1. **State Persistence**: Store maintains state across navigation
2. **Async Operations**: Handles loading states and API calls
3. **Clean Navigation**: Type-safe routing between views
4. **Dependency Injection**: Clear dependency management through composition root

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
3. **Interface Segregation**: Clean separation between different parts of the app
4. **Immutable State**: State changes are handled through actions only
5. **Thread Safety**: Async operations are handled safely

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 6.0
- Strict Concurrency Checking enabled
- SwiftUI 5.0

## Development Practices

- **Strict Concurrency**: All async/await operations are properly marked and checked
- **MainActor Usage**: UI updates are explicitly handled on the main thread
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Swift's type system for compile-time safety
- **Modern Swift**: Uses latest Swift features like macros and property wrappers
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Built entirely with Apple's native frameworks

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `ScaleStateApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project


## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for stores and reducers
2. Implement deeper navigation stack handling
3. Add error handling middleware
4. Consider implementing state persistence
5. Add logging middleware for debugging
